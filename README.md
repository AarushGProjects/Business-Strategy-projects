# Case Study: Calculating Profit For A Credit Card Company

Analyzing an affinity credit card (special card only available to members of a specific group). Think of it like this - the credit card company is like Citibank and the affiliated group is a company like Indian Oil or Barista. The affiliated group has to pay some fees to credit card company (because the credit card company is providing this service to the group)

Consider parameters for the above problem:

Average card balance is Rs 1000. 
Each card has an interest rate of 15%. 
Membership fee is Rs 20 per card. 
Loss rate is 3%. 
Rs 25 operating cost per card. 
Rs 10 affiliation fee per card (cost to the group organization itself, so that their members get this awesome card program). 
6.5% cost of funds (that credit card company must pay to the bank where it gets money). 
Bill/statement is issued on 1st of every month. 
Credit-free period = 15 days from the bill/statement issue date.

There are two scenarios and all the following questions must be answered for both scenarios. There might be some terminology that may not be familiar to you. This is expected. We want to see if you can research and find out about them and then answer these questions.

For the below, two scenarios provide a monthly calculation of profits/losses

Scenario 1: i) The interest rate is simple interest. ii) Interest is calculated on a daily basis. iii) The average card balance is the average end of month balance. iv) All members are more than a year old.

Scenario 2: i) The interest rate is compounded quarterly. ii) Interest is calculated on a monthly basis. iii) Membership grows at 5% month on month. iv) Card balance grows at 5% per month for each member. v) The average card balance is the average end of month balance.

Consider 1000 customers for both the scenario, divide these 1000 customers into following groups(upon your assumption and understanding about the credit lending industry)

1.Customers who pay the bill within the credit-free period 2.Customers paying 30 days after the last due date 3.Customer paying 45 days after the last due date 4.Customer paying 60 days after the last due date(remove these customers for the complete calculation of the next month,basically, you are not supposed to provide further credit services to these customers)
